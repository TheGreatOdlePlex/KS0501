Mostly all info in main.cpp , small arduino max development onboard with two 8x8 led matrix, speaker on pin 9; annoying, two bright RGB's I didn't use. two buttons not really used
but added small font for numbers, serial color, and someones rotary encoder code which works really well, and some basic stepper motor control and status lights on bottom row which is 7
